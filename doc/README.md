Utabit Core 0.13.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Utabit Core](http://utabit.com/#download) is the original Utabit client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Utabit transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Utabit on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/utabit-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/utabitd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run utabit-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Utabit-Core to your applications folder, and then run Utabit-Core.
